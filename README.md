# Fact Shield üõ°Ô∏è

## Tagline
"Spot the Fake, Trust the Truth."

## About
Fact Shield is a web app that detects fake news. Users can enter any news text and get a True/Fake prediction instantly.

## Inspiration
We created this project to help people identify fake news quickly and easily. With the rise of misinformation online, a simple tool to check news authenticity can make a real difference.

## What It Does
- Takes news text as input.
- Uses a simple machine learning model to predict if the news is True or Fake.
- Displays the result instantly in a user-friendly interface.

## How We Built It
- *Language:* Python  
- *Framework:* Streamlit  
- *Libraries/Technologies:* Pandas, scikit-learn, TF-IDF, Naive Bayes  
- *Development Environment:* VS Code  

## Challenges We Ran Into
- Handling text processing for fake news detection.
- Making sure the Streamlit app runs without errors locally.
- Understanding how to deploy the app online for public access.

## Accomplishments We‚Äôre Proud Of
- Created a fully functional web app that predicts fake news.
- Successfully built an ML model integrated into Streamlit.
- Learned how to deploy a Python app online.

## What We Learned
- Basics of text classification using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes.
- How to create interactive web apps with Streamlit.
- How to structure a project for deployment and GitHub sharing.

## How to Run Locally
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn

Run the app:
streamlit run fact_shield.py
Open the browser to http://localhost:8501 and test the app.

What's Next
Expand the dataset for more accurate predictions.
Improve the ML model and UI.
Deploy publicly so everyone can use it.
